## Modern Infrastructure: From Traditional Deployments to Cloud-Native Architecture

### Learning Steps

1. **From HTTP to API**
   - Understand the transition from traditional HTTP-based services to modern API-driven architectures.
   - Learn about REST, gRPC, and GraphQL APIs.

2. **Monolith to Microservice**
    - [child page](vms_to_containers.md)
   - Explore the migration from monolithic applications to microservices.
   - Understand the benefits of microservices, such as scalability, resilience, and maintainability.
   - Learn about strategies for breaking down monolithic applications into microservices.

3. **Cattle not Pets**
   - Embrace the concept of treating servers as disposable resources (cattle) rather than unique entities (pets).
   - Understand the benefits of immutable infrastructure and automated deployments.

4. **Infrastructure as Code**
    - [child page](immutable_infra.md)
    - Explore tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes for defining and managing infrastructure.
    - Understand the principles of version control, repeatability, and scalability in infrastructure management. 
    - Learn about managing infrastructure using code and automation tools.
