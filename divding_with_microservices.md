### Breaking It Down: A Deep Dive into Microservices Architecture

With 75% of companies adopting microservice architectures as of 2025, organizations are increasingly seeking to enhance their systems' resilience, scalability, and maintainability. This trend reflects a growing recognition of the flexibility and efficiency that microservices provide, allowing businesses to adapt quickly to things from changing product requirements to traffic demand and request rates. With that said, the following outlines proven strategies to migrate from a monolithic architecture to microservices.

## Understanding the Architecture Types

### Monolithic Architecture
In monolithic applications, data and code are usually handled not just by a single codebase but with a unified database as well. While historically common, this approach has all too often proven to lead to lead to complex dependencies which increases scaling costs while creating complicated and high risk deployments.

### Microservices Architecture
Microservices break down applications into smaller, independent services, each managing its own data and functionality. These services communicate through APIs (typically REST, gRPC, or GraphQL) and can be developed using independant technologies. Each service maintains data locality, meaning it exclusively manages its own data storage, though the physical storage location can vary based on organizational needs.

## Migration Process

### Step 1: Identify Components
- Map out data objects, actions, and product requirements
- Focus on components that are frequently used or performance-critical
- Identify opportunities to merge similar data across services

### Step 2: Restructure Components
- Eliminate duplicate functionality
- Standardize data formats
- Address data quality and consistency issues

### Step 3-4: Analyze and Group
- Map component dependencies through static code analysis and dynamic request tracing
- Group related components that should become separate services
- Consider both technical and business logic when grouping

### Step 5: Establish the API Layer
The API should be:
- Stateless and version-controlled
- Backward compatible
- The sole access point for all data interactions

### Step 6-7: Implement the Migration
Consider a two-phase approach:
1. First migrate to macroservices (interim step)
   - Allow some data sharing
   - Move component groups to separate deployments
2. Then establish to true microservices
   - Establish independent data stores
   - Limit each service to specific functions

### Step 8: Deploy and Test
- Ensure all system components use the new services
- Verify no legacy data access remains
- Update and verify access controls
- Deploy gradually with incremental testing and establish rollback strategy

By following a methodical and systematic migration approach, organizations are able to transform their monolithic systems into more stable and scalable microservices while minimizing disruption to existing development and their customers. While it may sound daunting, the sooner this practice is in motion, the less coupled services will be going forward and positive consistent momentum can be a source of motivation for both business stakeholders who will see costs benefits, and developers who will now be able to spend more time on new feature development and no longer be bogged down with complex software coupling.
